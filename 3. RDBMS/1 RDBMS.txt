# In RDBMS we map related table using Foreign Key.

# RDBMS:
	Q. What is a Relational Database?
		- A relational database is a type of database that uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation(table) to another piece of data in the database.
		- Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.

	Q. What is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?
		- A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database.

	> Types of relationships in relational database:
		* one to one - where one table record relates to another record in another table
		* one to many - where one table record relates to multiple records in another table
		* many to one - where more than one table record relates to another table record
		* many to many - where multiple records relate to more than one record in another table

	- Example of RDBMS are mysql, postgre, sql server, oracle etc.

# Comparision between DBMS and RDBMS:
	- DBMS stores data as a file(either a hierarchical form or a navigational form.) whereas in RDBMS also, data is stored as a file but in the tabular form.
	- DBMS supports single users, while RDBMS supports multiple users.
	- DBMS does not support client-server architecture but RDBMS supports client-server architecture.

	- Examples of DBMS are file systems, xml etc. 
	- Example of RDBMS are mysql, postgre, sql server, oracle etc.

- Link logically related table usinf PK an FK.
- Redundancy of data is not only waste of space but also may lead to problem when updating data.
	- Like there is a person name Amir and address Kapan. This data is redundent means its present in 3 row.
	- Now at then time when we need to update time. What if we update 2 row with address with Jorpati.
	- Then this willl create error as person with same name Amir has address of Kapan and Jorpati.
- So instead of storing all data in one table break it in to two related table.
- And make it relational database.
- If two table has a relation which table should have foreign key?
	- The table that contains the foreign key is considered the child table, and the table that the foreign key references is the parent table(has Pk)?
	- A parent is the table that stores the primary key, A child is any table that references the parent with a foreign key.
	- We name these tables parents and children because the child inherits values from the parent (just like children in real life).
