Q. What is Schema in the Database Management System?
	- A schema can be defined as the structured design or blueprint of a database.
	- The overall description of the database is called the database schema.

# It can be categorized into three parts:
	- Physical/Internal Schema: Database-Administrator
	- Logical/Conceptual Schema: Programmer(BackEnd-Developer)| Database-Designer
	- View/External Schema: FrontEnd-Developer|User

	> Physical Schema: A physical schema can be defined as the design of a database at its physical level. In this level, it is expressed how data is stored in blocks of storage(eg: file structure).
	> Logical Schema: A logical schema can be defined as the design of the database at its logical level. In this level, the programmers, as well as the database administrator (DBA), work.
	    		  At this level, data can be described as certain types of data records that can be stored in the form of data structures.
			  However, the internal details (such as an implementation of data structure) will be remaining hidden at this level.
			  For Example: ERM
	> View Schema: View schema can be defined as the design of the database at the view level, which generally describes end-user interaction with database systems.
