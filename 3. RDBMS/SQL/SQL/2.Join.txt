- A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

- Different Types of SQL JOINs:
    - INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    - LEFT OUTER JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table (record of right table can be null)
    - RIGHT OUTER JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table (record of left table can be null)
    - FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
    - Self join

- INNER JOIN:
    - SELECT column_name(s)
      FROM table1
      INNER JOIN table2
      ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

    - kind of means SELECT column_name FROM table1 if table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

    - SELECT table_1.column_name, table_2.column_name
      FROM table_1
      INNER JOIN table_2
      ON table_1.ForeignKey = table_2.UniquePrimaryKey;

    - SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
      FROM ((Orders
      INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
      INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);


- LEFT JOIN:
    - SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
      FROM Customers
      LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;


- RIGHT JOIN:
    - SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
      FROM Orders
      RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
