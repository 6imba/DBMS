1. Relational Database:
	- SQL is used by RDBMS to communicate with Relational-Databsae,
	- Relational Database stores data in relational tables formate with row|column,
	- SQL databases are vertically scalable
	- Structure data
	- tabular schema,
	- tabular, relational databases.
	- Example of RDBMS: MySql, Postgrels, Oracels
	- new record added == new row added in table,
	- relation can be made between two tables,
	- Relational databases work best when the data they contain doesn’t change very often,

2. NoSQL or Non-Relational Databases:
	- SQL is used by RDBMS to communicate with Relational-Databsae,
	- NoSQL databases stores data in collection(document) formate with flexible document(key: value),
	- NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable,
	- Unstructure data
	- no Schema,
	- collection(document), non-relational databases.
	- Example of N-DBMS: MongoDB,
	- new record added == new document added in collection,
	-
	- Non-relational databases are therefore ideal for storing data that may be changed frequently or for applications or for applications that handle many different kinds of data.

> Non-relational databases often perform faster because a query doesn’t have to view several tables in order to deliver an answer, as relational datasets often do. 
> When starting a project, it is worth considering relational vs non-relational databases, in terms of their differences, to get a better understanding of the right solution for the project.
