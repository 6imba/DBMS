Q. Is there any other language besides SQL for relational databases?
    - During the dawn of relational databases, two major players were in the market: Oracle and Ingres.
    - Oracle based its database on SQL, an IBM invention.
    - Ingres based its database on QUEL, a query language created at Berkeley Univerity.
    -   When ANSI decided to pick a standard for database queries, they opted for SQL. And that’s how SQL because, well, the standard.
    - Many people, though, consider QUEL a superior query language, compared to SQL, and some argue the only reason ANSI picked SQL was because it was IBM’s standards. Eventually, Ingres adopted SQL.
    - But yes, once upon a time, there was QUEL.
