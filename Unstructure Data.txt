- Unstructured data is information that is not arranged according to a pre-set data model or schema, and therefore cannot be stored in a traditional relational database or RDBMS.
- Text and multimedia are two common types of unstructured content. Many business documents are unstructured, as are email messages, videos, photos, webpages, and audio files.

- Unstructured data can be created by people or generated by machines.
	> Here are some examples of the human-generated variety:
		- Email: Email message fields are unstructured and cannot be parsed by traditional analytics tools. That said, email metadata affords it some structure, and explains why email is sometimes considered semi-structured data.
		- Text files: This category includes word processing documents, spreadsheets, presentations, email, and log files.
		- Social media and websites: Data from social networks like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook, and websites such as Instagram, photo-sharing sites, and YouTube.
		- Mobile and communications data: Text messages, phone recordings, collaboration software, Chat, and Instant Messaging.
		- Media: Digital photos, audio, and video files.


	> Here are some examples of unstructured data generated by machines:
		- Scientific data: Oil and gas surveys, space exploration, seismic imagery, and atmospheric data.
		- Digital surveillance: Reconnaissance photos and videos.
		- Satellite imagery: Weather data, land forms, and military movements.

- Non-relational databases such as MongoDB are the preferred choice for storing many kinds of unstructured data.

Q. How is unstructured data stored?
	- Unstructured data can be stored in a number of ways: in applications, NoSQL (non-relational) databases, data lakes, and data warehouses. Platforms like MongoDB Atlas are especially well suited for housing, managing, and using unstructured data.
